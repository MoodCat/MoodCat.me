\section{High-level product backlog}
The MoSCoW model is used to structure the high-level product backlog.
The items are listed according to the priority in relation to the other items in the backlog.
The backlog is translated to an actual list of issues on GitHub which is ordered using Waffle\cite{waffle}.

\chapter{Human-Computer Interaction}

\section{Introduction}
This section describes the interaction between MoodCat and one of its users, and how we measured this.
The user is very important for us, the user is the one that will use the application.
Our system is build for interaction between users and the system is even learning from user interaction.
The interaction between users is the chatroom that our music application is build around.
Users are also involved in actually improving the system.

\section{The user and their situation}

\subsection{Use case scenarios}
In this chapter we will elaborate the use cases we have made for our product.

\subsubsection{User wants to play music on the website MoodCat.me.}
\begin{itemize}
\item The user goes to moodcat.me in his browser
\item The user selects the mood they are in
\item The user clicks next
\item The user selects a room
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Whilst in a room the user wants to chat}
If the user is not logged in yet:
\begin{itemize}
\item Click on "login" in the top right corner
\item Click on the connect button
\end{itemize}
Everyone:
\begin{itemize}
\item The user clicks on the bar which says "type a message".
\item The user clicks "send"
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{User wants to do the classify game}
\begin{itemize}
\item User clicks on "Rating game" in the header
\item User clicks a song
\item User listens to a song
\item User selects the appropriate buttons for valence and arousal
\item User clicks submit
\item User gets 6 points
\item User comes back to the menu to click a new song to classify
\end{itemize}


%Beschrijving van context inquiry
\section{Context inquiry}
% A contextual inquiry interview is usually structured as an approximately two-hour, one-on-one interaction in which the researcher watches the user do their normal activities and discusses what they see with the user.
We did a context inquiry with 5 other students a the TU Delft.
The students joined the same chat room.
They were separated by some free space, so they would not be influenced by each other.
We just asked them to play with the system and we would see how they do.
To see how they experienced the system is quite interesting, a user acts different in the first few minutes of system use, when they're not quite sure what MoodCat is.
These are two very important aspects.
First off all we want to bind the user to our system, so he will use it and then we want them to keep using the system.
So, that the user comes back often, because he likes the system.\\
They could find almost all the features, they immediately found the rating of the song and the classify game.
Only the leaderboard, where you come by clicking at the points was a bit too hidden away.
This is something minor, but we want to change this in the future.

\section{Product design and claim analysis}
MoodCat is developed with the end-user as starting point, we tried to make the interface as intuitive as possible.
The interface should not contain a lot of information, so that the user remains the overview.
%What to say more
% Friso: I also don't really see the point of section 5.4. What are your claims, and how does the system you have developed prove them?

\subsection{Claim analysis}
MoodCat is developed for people to enjoy music together with similar minded people.
We were familiar with Twitch.tv, a streaming platform geared towards games. A big part of their success factor is the fact that users can interact with eachother while watching the stream. In our view this formula could also work with a music stream.

%Beschrijving van een bruikbaarheidsevaluatie uitgevoerd met het product
\section{Usability evaluation}
% Friso : Maybe include a links in the footnotes to an explanation on the two methods you name here. I have never heard of them, so some of the other reviewers also might not have.
\subsection{Cognitive Walkthroughs}
During the design of the product we did multiple usability evaluations.
We have done quite a few Cognitive Walkthroughs, with changing possible end-users.
We done this with the thinking out loud protocol, so we always knew there they where stuck or did not fully understand something.
When you do not ask people to think out loud, they would sometimes hide some mistakes, which later on can be very important.
We gave the users the task to explore the functionalities of the system.
We got some feedback and found that very valuable.
Mainly, because in an early stage you know what goes wrong and right. 
So, anticipating on the results is therefore a lot easier than later on.
\subsection{GOMS}
At the end of our project we did a Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection rules analysis (GOMS).
We asked them to do some task and watched how quickly they preformed these tasks.
These where the tasks of the Cognitive Walktrough, only split into multiple sections.
We wanted to see where sometime went wrong. 
So, not that the user had some difficulties with finding a chatroom, but that they spent longer on the select a mood page than we would expect.
These more specific failures gave us more information to work with.

As a developer I want to make an algorithm that takes low-level music features and produces an valence-arousal vector.
&
\begin{enumerate}
\item Make a predictor implementation using the recommendation-library for the valence/arousal vector.
\item Make a test dataset with songs and our personal preferences to test our algorithm.
\item Test the predictor comparing our preference with the predicted preference.
\item Tweak the algorithm in order to produce reasonable vector-predictions.

\item Jan-Willem took over this issue.

Problems we encountered:\\
Writing a document often did not result in creating the glossaries and references subsections. We need to ensure this will become a standard section of writing a document.\\
Reviewing Pull-Requests was somewhat vague, and often took too long to complete and give feedback. We agreed on a better workflow to make sure we keep the overview in Pull-Requests. This will also be brought up every sprint meeting.\\
We found we sometimes were too passive as issue assignee. Dividing subtasks did not often occur until late in the week. We agreed to make smaller issues and bring this up earlier.\\
We did not really do pair programming the way we wanted to. This is partly due to the large amount of documentation we had to do this week. We agreed to do this more actively in the next sprints.\\
We agreed on keeping time better by editing the storypoints on waffle.io during the sprint.
